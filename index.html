                        I graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology, having recieved a Bachelors of Science in Game Design & Development and
						a minor in Creative Writing.
                        I am very passionate about game design. I strive to create fun and lasting experiences for players
						and hope to inspire people through my games. 
                        I enjoy programming, and have experience in developing with many industry standard
                        languages, such as C/C++, C#, Python, etc.
                        I have also worked with AAA game engines and have experience in Frostbite, Unreal, and Unity. 
                        While I am currently not looking for employment opportunities, please feel free to reach out!
